# Overview:
	This is a Group project for our software design class.
 	The website  we made is meant to make it easy to get the information you need about chronic disease indicators. 
 	This data can be used by those interested in different types of chronic diseases in the United States within the past ten years. 
	It could be someone interested in collecting data about the distribution of chronic diseases across the US, people with chronic diseases, or any researcher looking for such data to compare or study different chronic diseases. 
	It could also prove useful for pharmaceutical companies, patients, caregivers, and those interested in healthcare data and graphics of such data.


## Who is this for?
	Users who are interested in general information about chronic diseases could include researchers, pharmaceutical companies, patients, caregivers, and those with a general interest in healthcare in the USA. 
	Also those who are interested in more specific information about the topic.

## What is this for?
	To learn about the demographics, distribution, and chronic diseases they may have. 
	Some examples of this could include chronic diseases by race, sex, ethnicity, age, and common comparisons between them. 
	This could be chronic diseases in men versus women, chronic diseases in all age ranges, and by state.

# How to use the Website:
	First, run the homepage.py file, as that is the python file that makes the website.
 	On the website, select the stratification(s) to further enhance your search.
  	Click on the enter button, and a response will be displayed on the screen.

 ### What computer does this website work best on?
 	Works best on a windows computer with a screen size of 1920Ã—1080
